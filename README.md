<h2>Modal estimation with frequency-warped ESPRIT</h2>

<p> Frequency-warped ESPRIT helps in estimating beating modes in the low frequency spectrum. A time-domain optimization scheme further tunes the estimated modal parameters. Subband ESPRIT or frequency-zoomed ESPRIT replaces warping with bandwise filtering and downsampling, but is slower than FW-ESPRIT.
